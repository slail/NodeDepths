    The distance between a node in a Binary Tree and the tree's root is called the node's depth.
    Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns the sum of its nodes' depths.
    Each BinaryTree node has an integer value, a left child node, and a right child node.
    Children nodes can either be Binary Tree nodes themselves or None / null,
